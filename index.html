<h3>About</h3>

 Hi, I'm Chenyuan Liu. 

I am currently pursuing my M.Eng degree at the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/liheng/zh_CN/index.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Heng Li</a>. I received my B.Eng degree from Central South University, also under Prof. Li's guidance. My research interests focus on machine learning applications and Embodied AI.
